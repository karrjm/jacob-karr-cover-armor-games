Dear Team at Armor Games Studios,

I am **excited** to apply for the position of **Junior Production Associate** at Armor Games Studios. With a genuine passion for game development and a proven track record in production, I believe I am an ideal fit for this role.

During my time as a **Unity AR Engineer**, I led a talented team in developing and releasing **Stout's Mobile Augmented Reality Tour of Art (SMART-Art)**. It was an exhilarating journey overseeing the entire software development lifecycle. I collaborated closely with team members, communicated project requirements effectively, and eagerly sought feedback to refine our designs. By streamlining the development pipeline and creating user-friendly in-engine tools, I significantly enhanced efficiency and productivity.

Beyond my production experience on SMART-Art, I possess a diverse skill set that aligns with the Junior Production Associate role. As a **Unity Coding Teacher** at **Concorde Education**, I facilitated collaborative learning sessions for students of diverse backgrounds and skill levels. This experience honed my communication and problem-solving skills while allowing me to adapt my teaching methods to meet individual needs.

Moreover, my background as a **Game Programmer** and **Technical Artist** on my university capstone project has provided me with a profound understanding of game development processes. I thrived in cross-disciplinary collaboration, actively contributing to lighting development and providing technical assistance to artists, ensuring a cohesive visual style.

Additionally, my proficiency in image creation/editing, knowledge of **Google Sheets** and **Notion**, and familiarity with social media platforms like **Twitter** make me well-suited for various production and social media tasks. I am highly organized and excel both independently and within a team, making me an excellent candidate to assist in creating and implementing social media marketing plans.

Thank you for considering my application. I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to join Armor Games Studios and contribute to the success of indie developers through my production expertise, collaborative mindset, and diverse skill set. Please find my attached resume, and I look forward to discussing how my qualifications align with your requirements.

Warmest regards,

Jacob Karr
